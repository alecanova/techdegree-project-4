 OOP Game Show App

This is a browser-based word guessing game. I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen and physical keyboard.

I costumized CSS with animation, supplied by animation.css, to the onscreen keyboard and the win and lose screen.
